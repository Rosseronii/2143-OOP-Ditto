# P01 - Stack Upgrade

### Ross Ditto

### Program Description:

An array-based stack data structure is utilized to insert/remove int values which are then printed starting from the last value added. If the stack is empty then the program prints out an error message stating the stack is empty. If the stack is full then a new array that is double the size of the previous one will be created, and the stack before will be reallocated to have a large enough stack size. Every time the stack resizes, the program prints out the action (either stack growing or stack shrinking) and the stack size.
