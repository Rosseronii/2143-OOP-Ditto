# Definitons

* Abstraction
  * The hiding of unnecessary details of an object from the user to reduce complexity.
# 
* Attributes / Properties
  * Information that is stored in a class or instance to represent the quality/state of said class/instance.
#
* Class
  * A template that defines the variables and methods particular to that kind of object.
#
* Class Variable
  * Defines a specific attribute/property for a class. It may be referred to as a member variable/static member variable.
#
* Composition
  * A way of combining objects/data types into more complex ones. A class that references one or more objects of other classes.
#
* Encapsulation
  * The bundling of data along with the methods operating on that data into a single unit.
#
* Friends
  * A friend of a given class is given the same access as methods to private and protected data.
#
* Inheritance
  * The child of a parent class inherits all the public and protected properties and methods.
#
* Instance Variable
  * Defines a specific attribute/property for a variable.
#
* Member Variable
  * A variable that is associated with a specific object and is accessible for all its methods.
#
* Method
  * Methods are the actions that perform operations on a variable. A method accepts parameters as arguments and then produces an output when called after manipulating the parameters.
#
* Multiple Inheritance
  * When an object or class can inherit characteristics/features from more than one parent object/parent class.
#
* Object
  * An abstract data type, can include multiple properties and methods.
#
* Overloading
  * Lets the coder define the same method multiple times for the ability to call those methods with different argument lists.
#
* Polymorphism
  * The ability of an object to possess many different forms.
#
* Public / Private / Protected
  * Instance methods that determine what can access them.
  * Public = everyone is allowed access
  * Private = only members of the same class can access
  * Protected = members of subclasses are allowed to access as well
#
* Virtual
  * a nested inner class whose functions and member variables can be overridden and redefined by subclasses of an outer class.
